# Stress Detection with Machine Learning
Stress is a prevalent issue that can have detrimental effects on an individual's health, productivity, and overall quality of life. However, detecting and managing stress is often challenging because it is a subjective experience and can manifest differently in each person. Traditional methods of stress assessment rely on self-reporting, which can be unreliable and prone to biases.

Machine learning-based stress detection offers several advantages over conventional approaches. It provides an objective and data-driven analysis of stress levels, bypassing the limitations of self-reporting. By automating the stress detection process, individuals can receive timely interventions, leading to better stress management and improved well-being. Now I will walk through the task of stress detection with machine learning using python.
